## Details
### <a name = "LATEST">LATEST - 29 Mar, 2017 (0197f39f)

* (GEM) update beaker-rspec version to 6.1.0 (0197f39f)

* (BKR-1049) Updating require to align with oldest supported PE version. This also matches the merged beaker PR. (eb794f0f)


```

```
* (BKR-968) Add puppet v4 install instructions (de809925)


```
(BKR-968) Add puppet v4 install instructions

Before, we only described the  method, which
defaults to installing Puppet's latest 3.8.z version. Now,
we've described that situation, and introduced
 to introduce installing newer
versions of Puppet.

[skip ci]
```
* (BKR-968) fix doc install errors (78c9370f)


```
(BKR-968) fix doc install errors

Before this change, the install instructions were incorrectly
iterating through all hosts and calling  on
each. That method is designed as a convenience one that
iterates over all hosts, installing on each of them, so you
can see how this compounds negatively for us. These changes
update the doc so that it's correct. They also provide a
little more readability, and work around the fact that the
chosen module (puppetlabs-mysql) has now been flushed out
with its own version of all the files we create in the
tutorial.

Beaker recently reorganized the directory structure of their docs, which broke this link.

```
(MAINT) pinning specinfra to pass testing

Specinfra's newer versions (>=2.59.1) inspect classes and use
their name method. Hocon shadows the class.name method, and
breaks as such. There's a separate issue to fix the hocon
problem (https://github.com/puppetlabs/ruby-hocon/issues/75).
specinfra has decided to not use the name method either
(https://github.com/mizzy/specinfra/pull/561).
Once that's merged & released, this should be reverted.
```
* Fix example spec file in README (3af2c1a0)


```
Fix example spec file in README

While following this example, I needed this change to get the tests to pass.

[The documentation for beaker](http://www.rubydoc.info/github/puppetlabs/beaker/Beaker%2FDSL%2FHelpers%2FPuppetHelpers%3Aapply_manifest_on) explains why:

> `:catch_failures` (Boolean) — default: `false` — By default `puppet -apply` will exit with 0, which does not count as a test failure, even if there were errors or changes when applying the manifest. This option enables detailed exit codes and causes a test failure if `puppet -apply` indicates there was a failure during its execution.

```
Enable the proxy feature available in beaker cli.

Improves acceptance testing performance and lowers network traffic to package
respositories with beaker-rspec.

Running a suitably configured proxy cache to act as a package cache, add the
following nodeset configuration.



---
CONFIG:
  package_proxy: http://<proxy_addr>:<proxy_port>



Beaker supports Debian (APT) and RHEL/Centos (RPM) based package proxies out of the box. See beaker --help (package-proxy) for further details.

Example, Squid is a suitable local package cache,

* (BKR-467) beaker-rspec does not correctly update os when cycling... (a6b3e503)


```
(BKR-467) beaker-rspec does not correctly update os when cycling...

...through hosts

- found that beaker was unable to complete its acceptance tests when
  provided with multiple SUTs of multiple os types in the same hosts
  file
- need to correctly detectos when we switch to a new os, otherwise we
  assume that we are executing on the same os and generate the wrong
  command strings
- keeps a hash of known hosts associated with their os type so that we
  don't have to run detect_os (which can be somewhat time expensive)
  more than once per-SUT

painful. This patch adds the option to turn colors off.

Patch RS_DESTROY behavior
```
* Patch RS_DESTROY behavior (5161054d)


```
Patch RS_DESTROY behavior

QA-723's implementation moved the logic for `@options[:preserve_hosts]`
out of the `Beaker::NetworkManager#cleanup` method to
`Beaker::CLI#execute!` and beaker-rspec doesn't use the CLI, so the
logic would have to be duplicated here, or beaker would need a patch to
move it back.

It doesn't really make sense for the cleanup method to conditionally
cleanup, and it doesn't make sense for beaker to be inspecting the
success state of RSpec, so beaker-rspec can be changed to work.
